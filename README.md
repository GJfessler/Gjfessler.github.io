today we are going to talk about my interests and hobbies

# Music

The outkast is one of my favorite bands because the songs have a somewhat deep meaning and are just very catchy in general

another artist that I like is Michael Jackson, though he isn't with us in the world anymore, his songs are very enticing and just like the outkasts his songs are rythmic and catchy
